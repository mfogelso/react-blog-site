        <h1>About This Blog</h1>
        <p>
            This blog is being used to deploy some of my story ideas for a legacy board game I am slowly working on. All the stories take place in the same world at the same time, and will serve as background stories for the game's characters. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a personal side project that will probably be years in the making, but it's always fun to have some writing and big ideas to look forward to!
