                Welcome to my first React blog! This blog was created with a React framework, with data hosted on MongoDB Atlas, user authenticated with Firebase and deployed through Google Cloud services. Styling was left simple, with emphasis on learning new technical skills.</p> 
            <p>
                I will use this knowledge to create a new and improved site for parents to track their children's illnesses, complete with printable summaries to bring to the doctor's office.
