            `Dried meat. Fur blanket. Fire starters. Cat looked over her meager possessions laid out on the damp soil. Her eyes flitted around the empty tent.`,

            `Satisfied she was alone, she reached down under a pile of logs and pulled out her most prized possessions, a bow and a quiver of three arrows. They were poorly made and seldom used, but it was her best chance at survival.`,
        
            `"You know, leaving your bow strung is a good way to break it." Cat swung around, glaring at the intruder, before quickly averting her eyes down and bowing her head in deference.`, 
        
            `"Chief Goldeneye, I bow to your wisdom." Cat met eyes with her leader, looking into the golden pupils that matched her namesake. They were as cold and emotionless as ever. Cat glanced down at her bow, her heart sinking. She couldn't unstring the bow. She could barely even pull it. "I am sure you are pleased. You finally can get rid of me." She said with a little more venom than she anticipated. But the chief stared on.`,
        
            `"Give it here. I will help you." The chief, wearing little else besides simple leathers and war paint, extended her hand. Cat held tighter to her bow, her only source of protection when she left her Kin.`, 
        
            `"You would like that, wouldn't you? You know I have not mastered the Change," Cat said.`,
        
            `Chief Goldeneye cocked her head. "Yes, you are right. I believe the bow is a crutch. Without its support, you can fully give yourself  to your birthright." The chief's hand dropped though, resigned. She continued, "You know I wish you well. You may be our only chance."`,
        
            `"Then we are doomed beyond all imaginings." Cat voiced cracked, trying to hold back sudden tears. Chief said nothing to that. No words of encouragement. No subtle salute to her selfless act. She just stared and stared. Cat had to break the silence.`,
        
            `"Well I'll be off, then. If, by some miracle, I return with their location...perhaps I could-"`,
        
            `"Never mind that. You will return. I have seen the signs. And you will return in your true form." The Chief sniffed. She turned to leave into the morning dew, calling over her shoulder as she walked out, "Believe in yourself, daughter. I do."`,

            `The smell of bubbling flesh filled the hut in the pre-dawn darkness. Liquid gold dripped down the warrior's arm as he held the tip of the needle to his flesh, glowing white with heat. If it hurt, he didn't show it, his face calm as he checked his work. The gold burned into his flesh started to resemble symbols, his tale of glorious battle.`,

            `His head snapped up as a war horn sounded, shattering his focus. His needle fell to the ground, instantly cool before it landed, forgotten for now. Gold spotted the ground in a trail as he shot out of his mud hut and sprinted to the rally grounds.`,
        
            `Even with his speed and the early hour, he was not the first to arrive. Tight ranks of warriors stood tall in the darkness, lit only by a large, solitary brazier in the front of the cleared field. The Watch Commander smirked at Brass as he fell in to the front right column. Into his position as strike leader.`, 
        
            `All was quiet, save for the calls of exotic birds and the chittering of deadly critters. The oppressive heat blanketed them all. The heat that smothered the entire jungle, swallowing its sounds.`,
        
            `"Morning." The Watch Commander said, standing at the front of formation. A resounding "HUH!" greeted him from the team of twenty. He nodded in acknowledgment, then continued.`,
        
            `"Alright, I'll cut right to it. Our dear friend the Warden is on her way here. Ahead of schedule. She thinks to surprise us before the dawn. What she does not know, is that we do not need the sun!"`, 
        
            `Another "HUH!" rose sharply from the formation, quickly falling silent again.`, 
        
            `"We have less than an hour before she arrives. Let us make her feel welcome." He paused with the weight of unspoken commands. "Dismissed."`,
        
           `The outpost exploded with activity as the warriors raced across the outpost, gathering up weapons and tearing down banners. New banners were raised in their stead. Banners of black and gold.`,
        
            `"Brass, to me." The Watch Commander called out. The warrior with dripping gold stopped folding a banner, passing it to another warrior instead of letting it fall to the ground. He ran over to join the his superior, who raised an eyebrow at him as he arrived. Then they turned and began walking through the clearing together. "You were late."`,
        
            `Brass sighed. "Yea, Arden. I was trying to get some beauty sleep. You keep saying I need some, with a face as ugly as mine."`, 
        
            `Arden smiled and glanced sideways at him. "When I walked by last night, I heard some beauties, but not much sleep."`,
        
            `Brass allowed himself return the smile, then his smile faltered. "Sleep is for the tired. I am not tired."`,
        
            `"You mean you don't want to sleep." Arden stopped and faced him, clapping him on the shoulder. "Look. I know, Brass. They haunt me too. But it's not something that will just go away if we don't face it. We must learn to deal with our demons."`,
        
           `"I do. Through battle."  Brass brushed off Arden's hand, looking at him with hardened eyes. An understanding passed between them, of a shared torture. Then it passed. Arden nodded, and they started moving again through the activity.`,
        
            `"Have the time to finish your story before your girlfriend gets here?" He gestured towards the bubbling flesh capturing a small gold symbol on his arm.`,
        
            `"Too many things to do. Besides, I think she likes my rugged visage." They both shared a chuckle over that, and Brass unbuckled his gleaming sword from his belt, dropping it in the growing mound of weapons as they walked by.`, 
        
            `The orange glow from the sword faded slowly as the sun began to break through the trees.`,

            `Gwin lounged at her wooden desk with a book in her hands. A sphere of orange fire crackled softly in a small glass vase, illuminating her work. Just her, her book, and silence. Silence was a beautiful thing.`, 

            `"We're going to die down here, aren't we?" A meek voice came from the darkness behind her.`,
        
            `Gwin sighed inwardly, the beautiful silence, and her concentration, broken. Not bothering to turn back, she said "What makes you say that?"`, 
        
            `"It's been two days - the storm should have cleared by now. It's never taken this long to clear. We have no food and we're losing air by the second. By my calculations, with the amount of fire blossoms, and without proper ventilation, we'll suffocate in less than a day. What will the Jaina think? What will my mum think?! Died reading a bunch of useless manuscripts, alone in the dark."`,
        
            `"Really? That's what you've been spending your time on - calculations? For Hynah's love, Pel'lar, we're not going to die. I have a plan."`,
        
            `"You do?"`,
        
            `"Yes." Gwin slowly turned another page under the fire blossom's light, her feet still propped up on the desk.`, 
        
            `She heard Pel'lar padding up behind her. "Well, what is it?! We're going to die if we don't do anything!" His hands rocked her chair as he shouted.`, 
        
            `"Pel'lar, stop being dramatic. We've been through worse. Truth is though, I'm just waiting until you have a nervous breakdown and pass out, leaving me with more air."`,
        
            `"Gwin, this is serious!" He threw up his arms and started pacing up and down the aisle.`,
        
            `Gwin just sat there, a smug expression filling her face. But underneath it, she was worried. They were alone in the library, with no way back to the main complex. The storm had consumed the entire fifty foot tall library under its massive sand waves. Even the flue access had surely been covered. Yes, the work they did at the library was important, but was is important enough for a rescue mission?`, 
        
            `She needed time to think, without distractions. She called to Pel'lar, "Just let me just finish this entry. It's really quite fascinating."`,
        
            `Pel'lar broke into a string of curses, kicking bookshelves and punching books as he flounced away, taking his nervous energy with him. That'll work.`,
        
            `Gwin put down her book and took a large breath, trying to focus. She had hoped the storm would lift the sand by now, but it hadn't, and there was no indication it would change. At least not soon enough.`, 
        
            `Her brain started running through ideas. Most of them ended up with them dead within the first five minutes of breaking the surface. If they managed to break the surface. She started to wish she had other skills besides research. She shook her head, trying to clear out the what if's, and looked around for options.`,
        
            `Her eyes fell on a large triangular sheet of metal lying against a bookshelf. It was about three feet at its widest, shining brightly in the light.`,
        
            `You're not ready. Galrin's voice echoed in her mind. With your grace, you'll be lucky to make it ten feet.`, 
        
            `Well, ten feet was better than no feet. She shoved off the table and walked over to it. The sheet started to hum with static energy as she approached. She didn't have a face shield, and the sand storm was sure to rip her to shreds...but....`,
        
            `She yelled out into the darkness, "I'm going to go check something!"`, 
        
            `Curses rang out in response.`, 
        
            `Gwin shrugged and hauled up the sheet, its razor edges lined with a thin glass border. She juggled the unwieldy mass into one arm, turning to grab the fire blossom vase in her free hand. Ready as she'd ever be, she set her shoulder and jogged over to a corner of the library, a set of spiraling stairs swirling up into darkness. With a steadying breath, she raced up them before her common sense kicked in.`,
        
        `--`,
        
            `Gwin reached the top out of breath, her head resting against the domed stained glass ceiling. She heard shouting below her, probably Pel'lar looking for someone to whine to. She was done with whining. It was time for action. Or so she told herself.`,
        
            `The firelight light shone up to a lever set into a metal circle in the ceiling. She placed her equipment on the landing and reached up to the lever, pulling it down with her body weight. It didn't budge.`, 
        
            `She tried again, straining with the effort. Still nothing. She didn't have enough leverage.`, 
        
            `Her eyes widened and she quickly pulled off her white outer robe, the symbol denoting her station. Station and responsibility meant nothing if she couldn't get out of here alive. She tore the fabric in half then twirled it down its length, securing one end to the curved lever, the other around the metal railing. A slapdash pulley system. Better than nothing.`, 
        
            `Here goes. She pulled again and a screech sounded from the lever as it pulled away from the ceiling, thudding into place. Gwin shot her arms up in triumph, as she reveled in victory. Then, remembering that she hadn't even gotten to the hard part, she untied her robe and pulled the lever to the right. A pop and a hiss sounded as the hatch above her slowly opened up. A small ladder slid down to the landing, inviting her up.`, 
        
            `Murmuring to herself that she was not afraid of heights, or darkness, or tight spaces, she used her robe to tie the triangular metal sheet to her back and started up the ladder. Her affirmations got louder and louder as she went higher and higher.`, 
        
            `But it was no use.`,
        
            `Her palms started sweating, her breath hitching raggedly as she tried to talk herself down. But the fear was rising up into her throat, closing it up as she tried to breathe. Suddenly she couldn't breathe at all. Her hands froze on the rungs as her mind stood still, alone on the ladder, in the darkness, up high. She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to think of something. Anything!`,
        
            `The blood started draining from her face as she tried to force breath down her throat. But she couldn't breathe! Her hands started to slip from the sudden weakness.`, 
        
            `Her hands slipped off the rung, dropping her down as her reflexes kicked in, her hands tightening on the next rung down. She opened her eyes again in shock. A surge of adrenaline ripped open her windpipe and she sucked in gorgeous breaths of air. Her now strong arms yanked her up and up and up to the top, until finally her hand slid onto a smooth wall.`, 
        
            `Okay, remember the training.`, 
        
            `She felt for the small knob and pushed the button in its center. Another pop, and the metal flap released, pushing outwards. Gwin immediately reigned it back in, expecting sand to start flooding into the flue. But it hadn't. In fact, she didn't feel any sand. She didn't hear any wind.`,
        
            `Gwin gently pushed open the flap again and looked outside.`, 
        
            `The dark light of a half moon shone over great sand dunes as far as the eye could see. Not many would guess they had been deposited there two days ago. Gwin let out a sigh of relief she didn't know she'd been holding in, and slipped out the hatch, falling a couple feet onto the sand.`, 
        
            `She stayed lying down, calming her breathing once again. Her body started to shake as the adrenaline died out, and with sudden nausea she turned over to heave up water, the only thing she'd had all day.`, 
        
            `Gwin wiped at her mouth and fell back onto her metal sheet, still tied to her back.`, 
        
            `It started crackling heavily and spitting dark purple sparks over the open sands, slowly lifting up off the dune, lifting her two feet in the air.`,
        
            `She smiled. Step one - done.`, 
        
            `Now she had much bigger problems.`,

            `Finnan felt the door click shut behind him. The sound felt heavy, too heavy for this quiet room.`, 

            `Empty tables littered the large area. Flagstones were covered by worn, elegant rugs. A modest hearth snapped brightly at the far wall.  On open shelves, painted globes of orange and red crowded together, vying for attention.`, 
        
            `And three broad men engulfed the only occupied table, closest the fire. Their faces swung towards him as he entered, their faces silhouetted by the flames.`, 
        
            `Ah, good. They might know what's going on.`,
        
            `He started towards them. "Good evening, gents. Mind if I share your seat by the fire?"`,
        
            `One of the shadowed men started sniggering, saying in a dark voice "No room here."`, 
        
            `Finnan glanced at the very empty seat at their table. Then back at them.`,
        
            `He weighed his options, shrugged to himself, and walked straight towards it, his hands in a flourish as he said, "Ah but look - what a discovery! Seems you may have missed one in your count. No matter, I shall remove it from the equation." He moved to sit down.`, 
        
            `The tallest man pulled the empty chair away from Finnan. He could see their faces clearly now. Fresh cuts and deep bruises marred their faces, their armor scratched and broken. Tough crowd.`, 
        
            `The tall one said in a nasal tone, as if his nose were broken, "Perhaps we weren't clear. This seat is taken."`,
        
            `Finnan couldn't help himself, "Yes. I'm sure your bruised ego could use a seat of its own."`, 
        
            `He immediately cursed himself to a fiery hell as the three men abruptly stood up, hands on their swords. Jumpy. I wonder what action they've seen.`,
        
            `He added with his hands up, "Steady now, gentlemen. I was just about to buy you all a drink and know your story. I'm afraid the frostbite has confused my good manners." Finnan waiting, and watched. The tall one's gaze cut towards the dark one, shifting his weight. Okay, that's what I thought.`, 
        
            `He chuckled slightly, then cleared his throat. "But I'm sure a round of the finest whiskey here will ease our first meeting. My name is Finnan Tealeaf. Well met, warrior." He extended his freezing hand across the table towards the dark one, who glowered at Finnan. Calculating.`,
        
            `They looked tired, and battered, and Finnan was betting on a hunch. He waited out the silent challenge, a friendly smile set on his face.`, 
        
            `Nothing moved.`,
        
            `Then the dark one's face cracked into an easy smile and the tension broke as he shook Finnan's hand. "Bergram's the name. You sure know how to make an entrance!"`,
        
            `"Well trouble is my favorite drink. Best served... warm." Finnan gestured towards the fire.`,
        
            `"Haha, come, sit with us. We could all use a bit of whiskey to warm the night. But keep that trouble away. We've had enough of it.`, 
        
            `"That's M'non," he said, pointing to the tall one as they sat. "And that's Crusher." Pointing to the other. A fitting name.`,
        
            `Finnan melted into the heated chair through the introductions, nodding his head in turn. "Well met, all of you."`,
        
            `As if on cue, a large man with a heavy white beard burst from behind the bar. One hand held three steaming mugs, the other balancing a food-laden tray. As he placed the goods down, Bergram said to the barkeep, "Klint, good man. Bring us that Florester you've been hiding away. This here chap is paying." With that he thumped Finnan on the back.`,
        
            `Klint gave Finnan a nod, "Admirable choice, young master. I'll get that straight away. Anything else I can offer?"`,
        
            `"I'll follow the good opinions of my new acquaintances, and take what they're having. If they have as fine a taste in food as they do in company, then I am in good hands."`,
        
            `"Of course you are, young master." Then Klint turned his head to address Bergram, "Is this the one you were waiting on? He doesn't seem like much." He raised an eyebrow then shuffled away.`,
        
            `Finnan put on a cool smile and rested his hand on a hidden dagger. They couldn't be looking for me here... He said, "Waiting on? I'm afraid he's right, I'm not much to wait for."`,
        
            `Crusher answered while the others tucked into their food, "No, Finnan Tealeaf. We wait on mistress. Take her up mountain. Passage still open."`,
        
            `Not for me then. Perfect. Finnan relaxed and smiled once more, "Up the mountain, so close to winter! I thought all the contesters had left a whole month ago. Is this what the mountain's done to you?"`,
        
            `"The mountain's trouble enough, but it's the beasts that put up the real fight. The likes of which you've never seen. Nor ought to see. We've already lost two. A couple of the finest fighters in the realm," Bergram said.`,
        
            `He sat in silence with the memories. Then continued, "But mi'lady wanted them cleared out before she came. As if those monsters could just be cleared out. As if she'd just be able to walk right up to the Heart. Like all this is a game."`,
        
            `"Well Bergram, this lady must have great confidence in your abilities, to send you up the Ice Heart with any hope of success. It is fortunate she  sent you so late in the season, when all the other contesters have left. Less for you to fight through!"`, 
        
            `Finnan leaned forward as if in secret and asked, What milestone did you make?"`,
        
            `Crusher pulled out a blue stone and set it on the table with a thunk, but it was Bergam who spoke, "The third."`, 
        
            `Finnan sat back and scanned the shelves on display. They were laden with red and orange stones, but only a handful of blue sat among them.`,
        
            `"Very impressive. It is indeed fortunate that my business does not take me to the Heart, and the mercy of your blades." Best not to tell them. Finnan absently ran his hand over the map tucked inside his coat.`, 
        
            `Klint returned to set a bowl of stew in front of Finnan, then placed tumblers of liquid amber around the table. He kept an extra glass for himself and toasted the group, "To deep pockets," he nodded to Finnan, "and fine friends," he nodded to Bergram, then sipped at his glass.`, 
        
            `The barkeep continued, "Ah, yes. it's been too long since I've tasted this beauty. But the occasion surely merits the opportunity," he gestured towards the stone on the table. "Want me to set it with the others?"`,
        
            `Bergram took a sip of his drink, "No, Klint. You know she'll crack our skulls together if we don't show her. Speaking of, she's late." He looked to the doorway.`,
        
            `Finnan felt a pull at his gut at the words. Words he'd heard before. It couldn't be. But he had to ask, "And, who might this lady of yours be? Sounds like a woman I'd like to know."`,
        
            `"The Lady Highcrest, of Greenmerrow. I don't say this of many I meet, but she can hold her own."`,
        
            `Dammit. Finnan threw back his whiskey as the door flung open once more.`, 
        
            `Covered in gleaming spiked armor and a menacing greatsword strapped to her back, a woman posed in profile in the doorway. The snow dutifully whirled around her, teasing her unkempt red hair. Showoff.`,
        
            `Klint called out to her "Young mistress, the weather is best enjoyed outside, so that we may keep the warmth in!"`,
        
            `Finnan just sat there like a mouse in a trap as her eyes found his. And narrowed to slits. She shut the door behind her and said, "Hello, brother." Then in the same voice, she flicked her eyes to the other guards at the table and said, "Guards, kill him."`,
